                                p.article-text A wine press of the foot trampling type located in an area known as A Portela, discovered by Eduardo Castro. It was excavated on a natural granite outcrop, rising slightly out of the ground and to a depth of just over 1m. The wine press that belongs to the stepping kind displays a calcatorium or main basin that used to house espaliers that are currently no longer in place. The space used for trampling the grapes has a duct that used to allow the grape juice to decant in to an imperfect semicircular shaped pit.
