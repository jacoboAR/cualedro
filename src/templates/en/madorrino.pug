                                p.article-text The <em>medorra</em> is an isolated funeral monument situated on a wide plain, making also a dividing line between Lucenza and A Saceda, just at the edge of the road that links this last place with that of A Madanela (region of Monterrei), and was used as a visual and dividing frontier many centuries ago. The burial mound, as shown by Rodríguez Colmenero, the first person to study it, takes the shape of a truncated cone that is 1, 5 m in height and 15 metres in diameter. <br>
                                | It shows clear signs of being despoiled, as it has already lost the top slab and, in its place, currently visible, is a ditch partially blocked off from where emerge the heads of three of the orthostates that form part of the granite chamber that originally served to take the weight of a top slap.
