                                p.article-text Densely populated in the past thanks to its position as custom and village, A Xironda is a compact village that has a magnificent arcaded oven to bake bread (similar to that of A Saceda) that serves as a sample of the magnificent popular architecture of this region. Of rectangular floor plan and communal use, the furnace stands out for its buttresses that reinforce the thick load walls that support its superb granitic cover.
